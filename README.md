# FIRE++

**FIRE++** is a header-only C++ implementation of the Fast Inertial Relaxation Engine (FIRE) algorithm for constrained/unconstrained numerical minimization.  The algorithm is described in detail in [*Structural Relaxation Made Simple* by Bitzek *et al.*, *Phys. Rev. Lett.* **97** (2006)](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.97.170201).
